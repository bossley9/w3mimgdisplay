# imgdisplay

The purpose of this repository is to provide a clean, simple, and efficient method of displaying images in terminal. It is designed for use with terminal file managers such as [vifm](https://vifm.info/) or  [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).

This repository is a fork from the source of [w3m](https://sourceforge.net/projects/w3m). While w3m already provides an image viewing solution called w3mimgdisplay, it is filled with junk and not cross-compatible with certain architectures. Terminal image viewing should be [suckless](https://suckless.org), simple, and easy to setup.
